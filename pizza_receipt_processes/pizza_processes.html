					<h1>Brief</h1>
                <p>I would like to create a program which allows a user to create a pizza order. I want it to consist of components that allow the user to view the menu, add items to their order and provide contact details for a either a pick up or delivery order. The program should be easy to navigate and make sense to the user. It shouldn't crash or end without the user's choice eg. use loops.</p>
					<hr>
                <h3> Project backlog - overall overview and ideas</h3>
                <p> Not everything on the project back log can and will be completed however all of my ideas are in one place. They are prioritised in order of importance to the program.</p>

    <!-- Heading levels -->
    
    
<!-- Sprint one --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h1 id="1">Sprint One</h1>
    <h3>Aim: The aim for sprint one is to create a basic programme where the user can choose to see the pizza menu or quit the program. If they choose to see the pizza menu, they are also able to quit back to the main menu.</h3>
    <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

    <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/sprint_1_main_function_test.jpg" alt="">
    <h3>Reflection  </h3>
                <p> In this version I created a very basic menu, which in the future, will be the place where I can run all my functions from. I ended up creating a lot more functions than I had planned for a supposedly basic sprint one, however I think this will help me further along. This will save me time later when I am trying to implement more complex functions, the basic ones such as starline() and dashline() will already be there to use. Next version I am going to work on making a 'create an order' function where the user can add pizza's to their order.</p>
    <p>-------------------------------</p>
                
              <br>   <br>
    
<!-- Sprint Two --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h1 id="2">Sprint Two</h1>
    <h3>Aim: The aim for sprint two is to add an 'add to order' option to the main menu. The user can add different flavoured pizza's and the amount to their order and then view their order afterwards, as well as being able to view their order from the main menu. </h3>
    <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <h3>Sprint plan and backlog:</h3>
                <p> This is a basic plan for the different components that I would like to create in my first sprint. </p>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/sprint_2_kanban.jpg" alt="">
    <h3>Creating the function:</h3>
    <h3>Testing the function:</h3>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/sprint_2_out_of_range.jpg" alt="">
            <p> The 'list index out of range' error appeared when I tried to run the 'add to order' function in the testing file. This error came up because I wanted to print more items than I had in my multidimensional list. In order to fix this I added place holder text which I can go back and change later on when I clean up my code because the information is not relevant at the moment.</p>
    <h3>Adding function to main program and testing: </h3>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/sprint_2_testing_in_main_file.jpg" alt=""><br>
                <p> Everything works functionally!</p>
    <h3> Testing boundaries: </h3>
                 <p>I asked a classmate to test my program and they decided they wanted 80 pizzas. Although I already had parameters around this (a maximum of 10 pizzas, with an error message if a larger number is entered) I thought "What if someone wanted more than 10 pizza's?". In order to address this issue, I am going to add a conformation message that will give the user the option to change the number of pizza's they ordered, if it's above the 'maximum' number. This means that they can still order more than 10 pizza's but the program will catch out any typing errors.</p>

<!-- Sprint Three --------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h1 id="3">Sprint Three</h1>
    <h3>Aim: For sprint 3, I would like to change the layout of my code by making the main menu a loop function. This means that there will be less room for errors in future versions of my program, because the program will always come back to the main menu instead of getting stuck inside a function.</h3>
    <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <h3>Sprint plan and backlog</h3>
                <p> Sprint 3 is going to be a small sprint which will improve the functionality of my program in the future. There are not as many tasks I need to complete for this sprint.</p>

                <h3> Having two options and choosing one:</h3>
                <p>My first option is the main function which I made in sprint 2. In this main function, any option I chose off the main menu would take the user to a different function, but then the main function would have to be called again. In sprint 3, I created a main function which ran as a loop so that whenever the smaller functions in the main menu were finished, it immediately returned to the main menu instead of having to call the main menu function again. This allows the program to run fully so the user doesn't get stuck inside a function and not be able to reaccess the main menu. I think that my sprint 3 version of the main menu function will be the best choice because it will help me avoid any other complications or extra code later on in the proccess.</p>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/sprint_5_kanban.jpg" alt="">
    <h3>Creating two designs and choosing - exploring one option over another</h3>
                <p> For the update function I figured there were a few different ways to carry out the code, each one slightly different and incorporating varied ways of ending up with the same outcome. As a class we explored one option and wrote out a plan. I then designed my own plan as well, however I decided to combine the best components of both to create the best function. I wanted to make the function as simple as possible so I decided to create a second menu off the main menu under 'Review'. When this option is chosen, it prints out the customer order and then a second menu which has the option to change a quantity, remove a pizza or add a pizza. I decided to have a 'Change Quantity' option instead of an add or subtract a pizza to simplify the process and to remove any unecessary confusion with maths.  In version/plan 2 I created a design which asked for the index number of a row before asking what the user would like to do with it eg. add a pizza or change quantity. For me this didn't flow nicely and I though it would confuse user because they don't know what the options are before choosing to change something. I incorporated this into my version 3 by printing the option menu before requesting the index number. All three plans/versions included conformation messages which are important incase the user makes a mistake. My validations such as 'get_validated_integer' and get_integer_conformation' can also help with this problem. </p>

        <h1 id="7">Relevant Implications</h1>  
                    <h3> Usability </h3>
                    <p>Usability is how easy and usable the program is to someone who has never used it before, ie. a customer. A user should be able to recognise, diagnose and recover from errors without it disrupting the flow of the program, however even better, the application should be able to fix minor errors without the user knowing. To address this implication, I have implemented error messages throughout my program, which tell the user what they have done wrong and what should have been entered in a clear and understandable language. By adding parameters to validation functions such as ‘get_validated_string’, I am able to create an error message, specific to the information I am asking for such as ‘You have entered too many characters, please try again’. This feedback allows the user to recognise their error and gives them a chance to re enter their information to the correct standard.  </p>

<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>
The relevant implication, functionality, is about making sure my program works correctly without interfering with the users experience. This means that it doesn't crash, it adds up and stores values correctly and is free from bugs. Throughout the process of creating my program, I have addressed this implication by completing regular tests on the functions by themselves, before inserting them into the main program. This is to ensure they are executing correctly and making no errors. I also tested the main program each time I added a new function to ensure it had been inserted correctly and was working properly inside the program. On top of this, I tested my program with more extensive tests which were designed and executed like a story, with a customer ordering like they would over the phone. This allowed me to experience the users story by following a customers wishes and seeing how my program would work in the real world. By testing each function individually and then as part of the main program, it allowed me to find any bugs or errors that could stop the program running properly which would interfere with the users experience. Testing with user stories also allowed me to learn about the user and make the program function for them. 
 </p>

<h3>Future proofing</h3>
<p>Future proofing is making the code accessible to yourself and others to edit, change and update in the future. To address this implication, I have built my program using a function structure, where a new feature = a new function which can be easily integrated into the main function. This means that if a certain part of the program isn’t working, it is easy to find the problem and fix it because it won’t be woven into a whole string of messy code. Another way I have addressed this, is by commenting my code and adding doc strings to the beginning of each function. Docstrings describe the function and what it does which makes it easier for others to know what the code does, when looking at it with new eyes. Commenting the code also helps users to understand what a particular lineo the code is doing, for instance calculating GST. I have also run my code through a ‘code checker’ which ensures that tab indents, spacing and line lengths fit with the correct Python conventions. </p>
